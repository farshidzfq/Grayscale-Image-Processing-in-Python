# Grayscale Image Processing in Python

This project demonstrates grayscale image processing using Python. The workflow includes:
- Uploading a grayscale image.
- Binarizing the image using a threshold.
- Removing noise with morphological operations (Opening).
- Visualizing the results at each step.

## Features
- **Simple and Interactive:** Designed to run on Google Colab with step-by-step execution.
- **Efficient Image Processing:** Uses OpenCV for efficient binarization and noise removal.
- **Visualization:** Displays results using Matplotlib for better understanding.

## Technologies Used
- **Python:** Programming language for the implementation.
- **OpenCV:** Library for image processing.
- **NumPy:** Array operations for image manipulation.
- **Matplotlib:** Plotting and visualizing images.
- **Google Colab:** Online environment for running Python code.

## Requirements
To run this project, ensure you have the following installed (if running locally):
- Python 3.6+
- OpenCV (`pip install opencv-python`)
- NumPy (`pip install numpy`)
- Matplotlib (`pip install matplotlib`)

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/grayscale-image-processing.git
   cd grayscale-image-processing
   ```
2. Open the `image_processing.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab.
3. Run the notebook cells step by step.
4. When prompted, upload your grayscale image to see the results.

## Workflow
1. **Upload Image:** Upload a grayscale image through the Colab interface.
2. **Binarization:** Convert the grayscale image to binary using a threshold.
3. **Noise Removal:** Apply morphological opening to remove noise.
4. **Visualization:** Visualize the original, binarized, and cleaned images.

## Example
### Original Image:
The grayscale image uploaded by the user.

### Binarized Image:
The image after applying thresholding.

### Cleaned Image:
The image after noise removal using morphological operations.
